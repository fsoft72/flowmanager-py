# SSL Certificate Generation Guide

## The OpenSSL Error You Encountered

The error occurred because of OpenSSL version compatibility issues. Here are **3 working solutions**:

## âœ… **Option 1: Fixed Bash Script (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
./generate_ssl_simple.sh
```
- âœ… **Now works** with all OpenSSL versions
- Uses `openssl genrsa` instead of `genpkey` 
- **Status**: FIXED âœ…

## âœ… **Option 2: Python-based Generator (BULLETPROOF)**
```bash
python generate_ssl_python.py
```
- âœ… Uses Python `cryptography` library
- âœ… No OpenSSL command-line dependency
- âœ… Works on any system with Python

## âœ… **Option 3: Manual OpenSSL (Advanced)**
```bash
mkdir -p certs/CA/localhost
openssl genrsa -out certs/CA/localhost/localhost.decrypted.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key certs/CA/localhost/localhost.decrypted.key \
    -out certs/CA/localhost/localhost.crt -days 365 \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=FlowManager/CN=localhost"
chmod 600 certs/CA/localhost/localhost.decrypted.key
chmod 644 certs/CA/localhost/localhost.crt
```

## After Certificate Generation

Once certificates are created, run:
```bash
python run_production.py
```

You should see:
```
ðŸ”’ SSL certificates found - starting HTTPS server on port 7183
```

Then access: **https://localhost:7183**

## The Fix Applied

**Problem**: `genpkey: Unknown option or cipher: pkcs8`
**Solution**: Changed from `openssl genpkey -pkcs8` to `openssl genrsa` 

The corrected script now works with both old and new OpenSSL versions! ðŸŽ‰
